## HD GUI 2 Button Prompts Plugins
This repository is for hosting my project files and releases for a series of plug-in type mods for HD GUI 2, a mod that is part of the Dreamcast Conversion for Sonic Adventure DX PC.

The current plan is to support button prompts and controller graphics for 6 gamepads but may be expanded in the future.

- Xbox 360
- Xbox One
- PlayStation 3
- PlayStation 4
- Wii U Pro Controller
- Switch Pro Controller

The button prompt graphics come from ThoseAwesomeGuys, who have royalty free button prompts available that fit quite nicely within the SA1 aesthetic.

The controller graphics come from jimbomcmxc's publicly available vectors, with the exception of the Nintendo Wii U Pro Controller and Nintendo Switch Pro Controllers, which use the official press graphics for the gamepads, since no high quality free vectors seem to be available.
